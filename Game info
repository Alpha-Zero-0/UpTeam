Gameplay Mechanics

1. Character Creation
At the beginning, the player customizes their character by selecting traits that affect their abilities. For example:
Confidence (affects ability to charm bosses or recover from attacks).
Problem-Solving (affects ability to bypass traps and solve challenges).
Networking (affects ability to gain allies or use connections).
Players allocate a set number of points to these attributes, which will influence outcomes in battles and puzzles.

2. Combat System
Combat is turn-based and focused on strategy rather than pure strength. Players choose from a variety of actions, such as:
Attack: Use skills or wit to weaken the boss (e.g., “Present Logical Argument”).
Defend: Guard against incoming damage (e.g., “Request Feedback Session”).
Special Skills: Use unique moves based on your chosen traits (e.g., “Call for Mentorship” from Networking).
Each boss has specific vulnerabilities. For example:
KPMGrasp is weak against Problem-Solving attacks.
Deloitteful Liar takes extra damage from Confidence-based moves.

3. Resources and Items
Players collect resources throughout the levels:
Skill Badges: Earned by defeating sub-bosses, unlocking new moves like “Prioritize Tasks” or “Influence Stakeholders.”
Energy Tokens: Represent mental stamina and are consumed when performing certain actions.
Allies: Gain allies by making the right choices during dialogue (e.g., a mentor who provides extra defense).
Player Interactions
Dialogue Choices
Every boss encounter and some sub-bosses involve interactive dialogues. The choices you make will affect your combat and progression. For example:
PwCraven: “Why should I take the blame for this?”

Option 1: “Because we’re a team, and I’ll take responsibility.” (Networking +1)

Option 2: “You should! It was your mistake!” (Confidence -1, but immediate progress).

Skill Challenges
Between combat, the player faces skill-based puzzles, such as:
Organizing a chaotic work schedule to meet competing deadlines.
Solving riddles posed by bosses like EYSpy.
Networking to find hidden paths in the labyrinth (Level 4).
Win/Lose Conditions
Victory Conditions
Defeat all bosses across the five levels.
Collect all 5 Corporate Ladder Keys (awarded by defeating main bosses).
Reach the top of the Tower of Triumph and overcome The Struggle (final boss).
Failure Conditions
Energy Depletion: Running out of Energy Tokens means mental burnout, forcing you to restart the level.
Missed Opportunities: Failing certain skill challenges can prevent progression or weaken your character for later levels.
Alternate Endings
True Victory: Achieve the Graduate Job and gain recognition as the Corporate Hero.
Partial Success: Secure a mid-level position due to incomplete progress (e.g., missing a Ladder Key).
Failure Ending: Burn out in the middle of the journey, resigning to a less fulfilling path (but with lessons learned).
Example Gameplay Scenarios
Scenario 1: Combat with KPMGrasp
KPMGrasp: “What qualifies you to ask me these questions?”
Player Action: “Use Problem-Solving” → “Present Clear Evidence”.
Result: KPMGrasp falters, losing 20% confidence.
KPMGrasp attacks: “Obfuscate with Jargon”.
Player Action: “Use Networking” → “Call for Peer Input”.
Result: Countered! KPMGrasp’s attack is weakened.
Scenario 2: Navigating Placement Labyrinth
A fork in the maze offers two paths:
Left: An easier route but costs 3 Energy Tokens.
Right: A more challenging puzzle with a potential ally reward.
Player decides to solve the puzzle, unlocking Bain Sufferer, who provides a temporary boost to Problem-Solving for the next boss.
